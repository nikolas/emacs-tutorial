* What is Emacs [6/6]
 - [X] It's a text editor
 - [X] Can control most things in a computer with text
 - [X] Hence Emacs is an OS shell
 - [X] Emacs history: it's old, reflected in it's terminology
 - [X] However, the core is stable, learn today use tomorrow
 - [X] And it's new: extensible and adaptable

* What can you see [9/9]
 - [X] Assume we on a windowing system
 - [X] A frame
 - [X] One or more windows
 - [X] One or buffers
 - [X] Mode Line
 - [X] Mini-buffer (Ctrl-g)
 - [X] Scroll bars
 - [X] Off a windowing system
 - [X] Interacting with what you see

* Changing Text [7/7]

 - [X] Don't worry this is a copy
 - [X] Just type
 - [X] Just delete
 - [X] Home, End, PgUp, PgDn
 - [X] Selecting Text
 - [X] Insert past the end of a line -- continuation line
 - [X] Punctuation requires two key presses: Emacs expands on this idea.

* Keyboard control [9/9]
 - [X] Emacs predates (widespread use of) mice
 - [X] As with what you can see, works off windowing system
 - [X] Often faster
 - [X] Only uses the "main" keys -- so works on all keysboards
 - [X] The 2 control keys (and two more--shift, shift-lock)
 - [X] Control is simple
 - [X] Meta is harder -- also Esc
 - [X] C-v, M-v -- one screen at a time, and centre
 - [X] Now we can use this to do something useful


* Ctrl-G saves the day [/]

* Cursor Control [5/5]
 - [X] Move forward and backward; maybe easier than arrow keys, depending on
   keyboard layout
 - [X] Move to end of line, beginning
 - [X] Logical Control: word at a time, sentence at a time
 - [X] This is why keychords are useful -- keyboard "space" is too small
 - [X] What do we mean by a sentence: 

* Commands [/] 
 - [ ] Everything is a command
 - [ ] Single characters are "self-inserting"
 - [ ] Key Chords do more complex things
 - [ ] Menu's also run commands
 - [ ] Menu's and keyboard are linked
 - [ ] Help->Describe->Keyboard or Mouse Operation, 
   Remove Other Windows
 - [ ] Now do Remove Other Windows
 - [ ] Now do C-h k, C-x 1, to get to the same help, followed by C-x 1 to
   remove
 - [ ] In the menu, C-x 1 is listed. In the help 
      "It is bound to C-x 1, <menu-bar> <file> <one-window>"
 - [ ] TODO: The menu bar description doesn't tell you how to use it!
 - [ ] Some commands are bound to many places! C-h k C-h k which describes itself.

* Undo [/]
 - [ ] Undo works as expected
 - [ ] C-/, or C-_
 - [ ] Takes a numeric argument
 - [ ] Can also use C-x u

* Cut, Paste, Yank and Kill [/]
 - [ ] Cut and Paste is very useful
 - [ ] Emacs uses something slightly different: essentially, when ever you
   remove a significant amount of text at once, it's a cut.
 - [ ] Simplest form of deletion (backspace) *is* a delete
 - [ ] Most others are *kill* -- actually save the text also
 - [ ] How to kill
 - [ ] Select and kill with mouse
 - [ ] How to yank, and yank cycle
 - [ ] No special mechanism is required for cutting.
 - [ ] But, what about Ctrl-X, C and V? And isn't Ctrl-W a PITA, as it shuts
   windows in general? Cua-mode. See this later.


* Files [/]
 - [ ] But what about files?
 - [ ] How to open a file, how to save a file
 - [ ] TODO: "Visit New File" needs to be called "Open New File"
   
* Buffer
 - [ ] Can think of buffers like tabs (without tabs)
 - [ ] You can have many buffers
 - [ ] How do you select them, if you can't see them
 - [ ] List Buffers
 - [ ] Emacs never edits files, but buffers
 - [ ] You can discard (kill) a buffer with no affect on the file
 - [ ] You can have a buffer with no file (help)

* Windows 
 - [ ] Earlier we saw windows...
 - [ ] Emacs can have several windows.
 - [ ] Windows are not frames
 - [ ] We have seen how to get out of this
 - [ ] Now, let's try some use
 - [ ] Drag the mode-line to resize vertically
 - [ ] Can also split vertically, and drag the divider
 - [ ] "Selected window" works by clicking; cursor
 and altered mode-line tells you which is selected
 - [ ] C-x o also changes window
 - [ ] Unlike OS "windowing systems", you can move without changing

* More on commands
 - [ ] Control-Meta keypress
 - [ ] Prefix commands
 - [ ] Extended command sets

* Modal Editing
 
 - Emacs comes with many different modes
 - Each changes the ways, including the keys massively
 - Hopefully this is most intuitive.
 - Help screen, for example, space and backspace move up and down.

* ELPA Packages

 - We can extend Emacs with packages
 - There are many of these in Emacs
 - M-x list-packages
 - To complete, we will install, tutorial extra
